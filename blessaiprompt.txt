Welcome to Bless
The World's First Shared Computer

Bless is a decentralized edge compute network that delivers on-demand CPU and GPU resources close to end users, facilitating access to AI, machine learning, advanced data tools, and the evolving internet landscape.

Developers can deploy applications with ultra-low latency and minimal cost, while anyone with spare computing resources can run a node, contributing to the network and earning rewards.

‚Äã
Our Vision
At Bless, we believe that access to compute is a basic human right.

In the age of AI and computer-based automation, the ability to harness and utilize compute is as fundamental as access to electricity or clean water. By democratizing computing, we aim to bridge the gap between the haves and the have-nots. We envision a future where computing is accessible, equitable, and beneficial to everyone.

By eliminating the need for centralized infrastructure, we reduce costs and complexities for developers while providing opportunities for individuals to turn their idle machines into active participants in the global compute grid. The cause is simple: democratize computing and ensure that the benefits of the web flow back to its users ‚Äî not just corporations.

Our community is dedicated to providing value to our members and users. In addition to our platform features, we regularly offer exclusive content, resources, and events for our community members.


Introduction
Run and Participate in the Shared Computer

Welcome to Bless Network, the world's first shared computer. Unlike traditional cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud, Bless Network enables anyone to contribute their computing power and earn rewards.

Currently, there are two ways to participate in the Bless Network: 
Browser Extension Node
A lightweight, easy-to-use option that runs directly in your browser.

Native Node (Docker)
A more robust, standalone option for users who want full control and better performance.

FAQ



How many nodes can I run?

One account can link up to 5 devices, and run only one node per device. Running multiple nodes across browsers will not lead to increased rewards, and could lead to bugs that will not be patched. 



What devices can I run the extension on?

You can install the extension on any device that supports Google Chrome extensions. While it may work on mobile, we strongly recommend using a computer or laptop for better performance, as mobile devices may limit connectivity, drain battery quickly, and experience frequent bugs.




Can I use a VPS to run a node?

To ensure fairness to all users and simulate the actual environment we'll be running on Mainnet launch, VPS usage will not be rewarded.



Can I run multiple nodes on the same IP address?

While this is allowed, our platform has mechanisms in place to ensure fairness. This prevents any advantage based on multiple nodes using the same IP address.



How does the Chrome extension use my device's compute power?

The Chrome extension functions as a browser node that processes distributed computational tasks directly on your device. By using a WebAssembly sandbox, the Bless browser node ensures that all operations run securely within an isolated environment, keeping your system safe and uncompromised.



What are your data privacy policies for connecting my device?

We operate on a fully decentralized network, meaning your participation does not compromise your personal data. Nodes handle workloads in a secure, trustless environment, ensuring privacy throughout.



How does Bless ensure fairness across nodes?

Bless uses Dynamic Resource Matching, pairing tasks with nodes best suited to handle them. This ensures every task is matched to the best-fit node based on its capabilities, keeping the network balanced and efficient.



What is the difference between Bless Node and Bless CLI?

Bless Node is a native software or browser extension that any users can install and run to provide compute resources to the Bless Network and earn rewards. Bless CLI is the developer-facing software that allows the application developer to utilize the compute resources on the Bless Network.

Managing Your Node
Guide to managing a Bless Node with logs, shutdown, and identity persistence

This guide covers essential commands for managing your Bless Node, including checking logs, stopping, and removing your node. It also explains how to persist your node identity to prevent resets when restarting or removing the container.

‚Äã
Checking Node Logs
To monitor your node's activity, use:

Terminal

Copy
docker logs -f blessnetwork-node
‚Äã
Stopping the Node
To stop your running node, execute:

Terminal

Copy
docker stop blessnetwork-node
‚Äã
Removing the Node
If you need to remove your node container, run:

Terminal

Copy
docker rm blessnetwork-node
‚Äã
Persisting Your Node Identity
By default, your node identity resets if the container is removed. To prevent this, you can either store it locally using a volume or back up your identity to S3.

‚Äã
Option 1: Store Identity Locally (Recommended)
To ensure your node identity persists across restarts or container removals, map a local volume:

Terminal

Copy
docker run -d \
  --name blessnetwork-node \
  -p 9527:9527 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v ${PWD}/node-data:/app/keys \
  ghcr.io/blessnetwork/b7s:0.6.6.patch3
This stores your node identity in the node-data/ directory, preventing it from being lost when the container is removed.

‚Äã
Option 2: Backup to S3 (Cloud Storage)
If you prefer cloud-based storage, configure your .env file with the necessary S3 environment variables. This enables automatic backups of your node identity.

LEARN


Dispatching Work
How is a workload or transaction dispatched to your node?

In the Bless network, compute workloads are distributed to nodes using a combination of decentralized orchestration, resource optimization, and incentivization mechanisms.

‚Äã
1. Developer Submission
Workload Request:

The Developer submits a compute task via the Bless Command Line Interface (e.g., deploying a static site, running an AI model, or executing a dynamic application).

The request includes metadata about the workload, such as:

Resource requirements (CPU, RAM, bandwidth)

Priority and latency expectations

Duration or deadline for task completion

Packaging the Workload:

The workload is encapsulated in a secure and standardized format (e.g., WebAssembly). This ensures compatibility across all nodes in the network.
‚Äã
2. Task Routing and Matching
Node Discovery:

The Bless network maintains a real-time registry of active nodes, their geographic locations, and their available resources.

The network then identifies online nodes that match the task's requirements.

Optimization Algorithms:

To minimize latency, workloads are routed to nodes closest to the user or end-consumer.

Tasks are distributed based on resource efficiency, ensuring that no single node is overwhelmed while maximizing network utilization.

Incentive Considerations:

Nodes are prioritized based on their historical performance, uptime, and reliability.

Nodes are rewarded proportionally for their contributions.

‚Äã
3. Secure Distribution
Task Encryption:

Workloads are encrypted before being sent to nodes to ensure security and privacy.

Each node receives only the data it needs to execute the workload, preventing unauthorized access.

Decentralized Storage Integration:

For tasks requiring large datasets, the workload might reference external storage systems like IPFS or Arweave. Nodes fetch necessary data using secure protocols.


Verifying Work
How does Bless Network ensure transaction is verifiable?

Bless Network employs a Dynamic Verification Mechanism to ensure the integrity and reliability of computational tasks executed across its decentralized platform. This mechanism allows applications to select the most appropriate verification method for each specific task, enhancing both security and efficiency.

Key Components of the Dynamic Verification Mechanism:

Task-Specific Verification Selection:

Applications can choose from various verification methods tailored to the nature of the computational task. This flexibility ensures that each task is verified using the most suitable approach, optimizing performance and resource utilization.
Consensus Algorithms:

For tasks that result in binary outcomes (e.g., yes/no decisions), consensus algorithms like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) or RAFT are employed. Nodes participate in a voting process to reach agreement on the task's result, ensuring fault tolerance and consistency.
Aggregated Data Validation:

In scenarios where tasks involve data retrieval, such as obtaining price feeds for cryptocurrencies, nodes collect data and compute a weighted average. This method enhances accuracy and mitigates the impact of outliers or erroneous data points.
Benefits of the Dynamic Verification Mechanism:

Efficiency: By selecting verification methods that align with the specific requirements of each task, the network minimizes computational overhead and accelerates processing times.

Security: Tailoring verification approaches to task characteristics reduces vulnerabilities and enhances the overall security posture of the network.

Scalability: The modular nature of the verification mechanism allows the network to handle a diverse range of computational tasks, supporting scalability as the network grows.


Supported Machines
How is the Bless Network able to support such a wide range of machines?

Bless employs a robust and secure runtime environment to facilitate decentralized computing across a diverse array of devices. This runtime is pivotal in ensuring that computational tasks are executed efficiently, securely, and in isolation from the host system.

Key Features of the Bless Runtime:

WebAssembly (WASM) Foundation:

Performance: The runtime leverages an optimizing code generator to produce high-quality machine code swiftly. It is fine-tuned for rapid instantiation and minimal overhead during transitions between the host environment and Wasm modules, supporting the scalability of concurrent instances.

Language Compatibility: Developers can execute standard bytecode programs compiled from various languages, including C/C++, Rust, Swift, AssemblyScript, and Kotlin. This flexibility allows for the integration of multiple languages within a single application, such as implementing a JavaScript API using Rust.

Security and Isolation:

Sandboxed Execution: The runtime operates within a sandboxed environment, ensuring that computational tasks are isolated from the host system. This design prevents unauthorized access to system resources and maintains the integrity of both the node and the application.

Resource Allocation: Specific system resources like CPU, GPU, and RAM are exclusively allocated for Bless Network applications. This ensures that even when the host device is engaged in resource-intensive activities, the performance of Bless applications remains unaffected.

Customizability:

Configurable Environment: The runtime offers a configurable file that provides various options, including imposing additional restrictions on WebAssembly beyond its basic guarantees. This encompasses limits on CPU and memory consumption, allowing for tailored execution environments based on application requirements.




External API Calls
How to integrate external API for your app or service on Bless

A Quickstart Guide for Using APIs on the Blessnet

To connect your project to an external API, you'll need to update your bls.toml file with the right permissions before deploying.

Step 1: Add API Domains to Your bls.toml
Open your bls.toml file and, under the [deployment] section, add a permissions line listing your API domains:

[deployment]
permission = "public"
nodes = 1
permissions = [ "https://yourapiwebsite/" ]

Replace https://yourapiwebsite/ with your actual API's base URL.
Include the full domain and protocol (e.g., https://api.example.com/ not just example.com).
Subdomains must be separately listed. If you're using both https://example.com/ and https://api.example.com/, you need both in your permissions array.

Example with multiple APIs:

[deployment]
permission = "public"
nodes = 1
permissions = [ "https://api.example1.com/", "https://api.example2.com/" ]

Step 2: Call APIs in Your Code
Once your API domains are set up, you can make calls using fetch like you normally would:

async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch("https://yourapiwebsite/data");
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}

getData();

Only fetch is supported now.
The requested URL must exactly match what you set in permissions.

Important Notes
- Permissions are locked at deploy time. You can't update them later without redeploying.
- HTTPS only. The Shared Computer rejects non-secure HTTP API calls.
- CORS is your responsibility. Bless doesn't modify CORS headers. Make sure the API you're calling allows cross-origin requests.
- Security first. Only trusted, necessary APIs should be listed.



Blockless External API Access brings a tightly integrated end-to-end HTTP-to-WASM-to-P2P experience.

## üöÄ Highlights

Developers can now build full Web2-compatible HTTP apps using ECMA syntax and deploy them to the Blockless P2P network using Javy. This SDK provides:

- Express-style API routing
- Static file serving from a `public/` directory
- Automatic request parsing and JSON decoding
- Seamless integration with P2P compute via `stdin`

**Example usage:**

```js
// server/index.js
import WebServer from "@blockless/sdk-ts/dist/lib/web";
const server = new WebServer();

server.statics("public", "/");

server.post("/weather", async (req, res) => {
  const { city } = req.body;
  if (!city) return res.send("No city provided");

  const url = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const data = await response.json();

  res.send(JSON.stringify({
    city: data.name,
    temperature: `${data.main.temp} ¬∞C`,
    condition: data.weather[0].description,
  }));
});

server.start();
```

## Internals

### üîÑ Standard Input Routing

The Web SDK listens to `stdin` inputs in the format:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "/weather",
  "body": "{\"city\":\"Chicago\"}"
}
```

Static assets are served for `GET` requests, while dynamic routes are matched and executed with full parameter support.

**Runtime behavior pseudocode:**

```js
const input = readInput(); // stdin from ingress
const { method, path, body } = input.args;
const route = findMatchingRoute(method, path);

if (route) {
  route.handler({ body }, { send: console.log });
} else {
  serveFallbackIndexHtml();
}
```

## HTTP Ingress Layer

An updated ingress handler enables Web2-style HTTP routing and JSON parsing on the edge. It supports:

- Dynamic route mapping by `Host`
- JSON body extraction
- Permission injection per-host
- Forwarding request payloads to the P2P network

**Ingress features include:**

- JSON marshalling with fallback to parallel or fallback requests
- Return-type negotiation (HTML, JSON, Raw Binary)
- Base64 detection and decoding for binary outputs
- Full response caching based on path and host

**Sample ingress flow:**

```go
stdin := {
  "path": r.URL.Path,
  "method": r.Method,
  "body": parsedJSONBody
}

request := {
  "function_id": hostData.Destination,
  "method": hostData.EntryMethod,
  "config": {
    "stdin": string(stdinJSON),
    "permissions": [...],
    "number_of_nodes": 1
  }
}

response := dispatchToNetwork(request)
```

## üìÅ Static + Dynamic Output Handling

The SDK and ingress both support:

- `.html`, `.htm`, `.json`, and raw binary formats
- `data:*;base64,...` parsing and decoding
- Smart caching based on `(host, path, function_id)` tuples
- Fallback response support if index.html is not found

## üß™ Example Apps

### üì° Weather Example (Public API)

Included in the SDK is a working weather service using OpenWeatherMap. POST a city name and receive back current conditions:

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.bls.run/weather \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"city":"Toronto"}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "city": "Toronto",
  "temperature": "18 ¬∞C",
  "condition": "scattered clouds"
}
```
